# coursera-final-project-stop-sign-classifier

Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing (IBM) - Final project

Run the following commands in your terminal to run notebooks (notebooks \*_cv_studio\*.ipynb cannot be run):

git clone https://github.com/sinisabubonja/coursera-final-project-stop-sign-classifier.git \
python3 -m venv final\
cd final\
source bin/activate\
pip3 install -r requirements.txt\
python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=Python4CV\
jupyter notebook

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows you (among other things) to select which notebook to open. In the Notebook Dashboard, navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab. When you open a Notebook document, the associated kernel is automatically launched. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell at a time) by pressing shift + enter. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
